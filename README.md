Ryan's Home Configuration Mess
==============================

This is whatever Ryan has randomly set up. May not work for you, may also not
work for him. :-)


Some random points to note
--------------------------

- For this to work correctly the file `dotfiles/irssi-password` will need to be
  created. This is not totally secure in the sense the password is stored in the
  nix store, but at least the password is not in the repo.
